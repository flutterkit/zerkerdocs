## Introduction

Zerker is a flexible and lightweight flutter canvas graphic animation library.

With Zerker, you can create a lot of seemingly cumbersome animation effects, such as animated animations, pop-up animations, scene transitions, icon effects, and more.

At the same time, you can create a lot of simple games with Zerker. Zerker contains elements such as sprites, scrolling backgrounds, and atlases, making it easy to create game worlds with them.

## Getting Started

```dart
class MyZKApp extends ZKApp {
  ZKSprite _sprite;

  @override
  init() {
    super.init();

    _sprite = ZKSprite(key: "boy")
      ..animator.make("run", ["Run ({1-15}).png"])
      ..animator.play("run", 25, true);
    stage.addChild(boy);
  }

  @override
  update(int time) {
    super.update(time);
    
    _sprite.position.x++;
  }

  @override
  customDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    /// custom draw method
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```
