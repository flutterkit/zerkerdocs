## Introduction

Zerker is a flexible and lightweight flutter canvas graphic animation library.

With Zerker, you can create a lot of seemingly cumbersome animation effects, such as animated animations, pop-up animations, scene transitions, icon effects, and more.

At the same time, you can create a lot of simple games with Zerker. Zerker contains elements such as sprites, scrolling backgrounds, and atlases, making it easy to create game worlds with them.

class MyZKApp extends ZKApp {
  ZKNode _node;
