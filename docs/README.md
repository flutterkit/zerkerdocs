## Introduction

Zerker is a flexible and lightweight flutter canvas graphic animation library.

With Zerker, you can create a lot of seemingly cumbersome animation effects, such as animated animations, pop-up animations, scene transitions, icon effects, and more.

At the same time, you can create a lot of simple games with Zerker. Zerker contains elements such as sprites, scrolling backgrounds, and atlases, making it easy to create game worlds with them.

## Getting Started

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(widget.title),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Container(
            color: Colors.amber[600],
            width: 350.0,
            height: 350.0,
            child: Zerker(app: MyZKApp()),
